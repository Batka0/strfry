0.9.3
  * Limit on events that can be processed by a sync
    - Configurable with relay.negentropy.maxSyncEvents
  * Warn when NIP-11 pubkey is in incorrect format (#52)
  * Bugfix: Setting rejectEphemeralEventsOlderThanSeconds larger than ephemeralEventsLifetimeSeconds did
    not work because events were then considered expired
  * Config parameter to silence "Rejected invalid event" logs: relay.logging.invalidEvents
  * Detect overflows when rejectEvents* config params are set very large
